# Regression guard for the STORAGE TYPE of the microdata codes.
#
# The v0.7.0 data release re-typed nearly every categorical column of the
# microdata from `string` to `int32`. Until then the label blocks compared
# codes as quoted strings (`V0601 == '1'`), which Arrow cannot evaluate
# against an integer column: on an arrow Dataset -- what every read_*()
# returns by default -- it aborts with "Expression not supported in Arrow",
# and on an in-memory Table it silently pulls the whole dataset into R,
# which is the opposite of what this package promises.
#
# Every other label test needs the network, so the breakage only showed up
# once the new data were downloaded. These tests run each add_labels_*() year
# block over a one-row integer Dataset built in memory, so an unevaluable
# comparison fails here with no network at all.

# chaining ~80 arrow mutate() calls per year block costs a couple of minutes
# in total, so this file follows the other label tests and steps aside on CRAN

# Column names a labeller mutates for one census year. Every string constant

# handed to dplyr::across(). The Portuguese labels all sit on the right of a
# `~`, so they are skipped. Blocks for the other years are dropped so the
# dummy table stays narrow -- arrow's mutate() cost grows with the width of
